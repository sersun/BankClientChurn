# Project Overview

## **Introduction**
In today's competitive market landscape, customer retention plays a critical role in sustaining business growth and profitability. Customer churn, the process of losing customers to competitors, is a significant concern for industries such as banking, telecommunications, and retail. This project focuses on building a predictive model to identify customers at risk of churning, enabling proactive strategies for customer retention.

The dataset provided consists of customer-level information, including demographic data, account balance, tenure, product usage, and activity levels. Using this data, the objective is to conduct a comprehensive analysis, explore underlying patterns, and build a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of customer churn.

## **Objective**
The primary objective of this project is to:
1. Analyze the dataset to uncover insights about customer behavior and factors contributing to churn.
2. Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand data distributions, correlations, and potential anomalies.
3. Prepare the data for machine learning by addressing missing values, encoding categorical features, and balancing class distributions.
4. Build, evaluate, and deploy a machine learning model capable of predicting customer churn with high accuracy and interpretability.
5. Provide actionable insights and recommendations based on the findings to improve customer retention strategies.
