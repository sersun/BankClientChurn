# BankClientChurn

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling of customer churn for a bank's client dataset. The primary goal is to analyze customer behavior and develop a machine learning model to predict whether a client will leave the bank (churn). The repository includes detailed data exploration, feature engineering, and model building steps to provide actionable insights and accurate predictions.

## Key Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - Comprehensive visualization and statistical analysis of client data.
  - Identification of key factors influencing customer churn.
- **Machine Learning Modeling:**
  - Balanced and unbalanced data experiments to optimize prediction accuracy.
  - Random Forest Classifier implementation with evaluation metrics such as accuracy, ROC-AUC, precision, and recall.
- **API Development:**
  - A FastAPI and Flask application to deploy the trained model for real-world usage.
  - Support for real-time predictions via HTTP endpoints.
- **Visualization:**
  - Lift Curve, ROC Curve, Precision-Recall Curve, and feature importance visualizations.
